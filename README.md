SettingTwo_Boundaries_Sample_size.R is the code to produce the model described in the main paper for Setting 2.

SettingOne_Boundaries_Sample_size.R is the code to produce the model with the original algorithm for Setting 1 therefore the allocation ratio does change.

SettingOne_Boundaries_Adjusted_Algorithm_Sample_size.R is the code to produce the model with the adjusted algorithm for Setting 1 therefore the allocation ratio remains the same.

SettingTwo_Distribution_Expected_sample_size.R gives the expected sample size and distribution for the model given in SettingTwo_Boundaries_Sample_size.R

SettingOne_Distribution_Expected_sample_size.R gives the expected sample size and distribution for the model given in SettingOne_Boundaries_Sample_size.R and the same code is needed to find the expected sample size for SettingOne_Boundaries_Adjusted_Algorithm_Sample_size.R
