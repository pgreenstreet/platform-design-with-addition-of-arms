SettingTwo_Boundaries_Sample_size.R is the code to produce the model described in the main paper for Setting 2.

SettingOne_Boundaries_Sample_size.R is the code to produce the original model for Setting 1 before adjusting it so that the allocation ratio does not change.

SettingTwo_Distribution_Expected_sample_size.R gives the expected sample size and distribution for the model given in SettingTwo_Boundaries_Sample_size.R

SettingOne_Distribution_Expected_sample_size.R gives the expected sample size and distribution for the model given in SettingOne_Boundaries_Sample_size.R
